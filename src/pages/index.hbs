		<h1>Jazcss</h1>
		<p>
			Jazcss is my frontend framework that I use whenever I start a new project. It contains all the usual things you'd expect from any framework, plus a few extras. It's built to be responsive, customisable and semantically correct as much as possible. This site is using the latest version of Jazcss and shows off all the things it can do. It's also incredibly lightweight, weighing in at only 6KB after gzipping.
		</p>
		<h2>Tech</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Gulp</strong> - JS task runner. This is the master file of Jazcss and is what brings everything together to serve up a built site</li>
			<li><strong>Handlebars</strong> - HTML templating engine. Makes it easy to reuse components on multiple pages or create page layouts</li>
			<li><strong>Browsersync</strong> - Live browser reloading, CSS injection, static site serving and way more</li>
			<li><strong>Sass</strong> - CSS precompiler. Makes writing stylesheets sensible. Jazcss uses SCSS instead of Sass itself</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Style structure</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Base</strong> - Contains files that are core to the framework and shouldn't need much changing other than <code>variables.scss</code></li>
			<li><strong>Helpers</strong> - Classes that provide useful functionality</li>
			<li><strong>Layout</strong> - Like helpers, but specifically focussed on element positioning</li>
			<li><strong>Common</strong> - Style rules that target standard HTML elements such as headings</li>
			<li><strong>Components</strong> - The bread and butter of your project. Every partial should have a corresponding file here</li>
		</ul>
